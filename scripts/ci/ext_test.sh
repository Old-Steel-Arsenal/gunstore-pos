# One extension through the checks the core CI runs for each first-party extension
# (the `extension_list` input of _app-tests.yml, run by the maintainers' deployment pipeline).
# `make ext-test` runs this
# same script inside the dev stack, so a local run and CI print the same steps.
#
#   scripts/ci/ext_test.sh <bench dir> <site> <extension id> <extension app root>
#   scripts/ci/ext_test.sh --check <bench dir> <extension id> <package dir> <extension app root>
#       (every refusal below for the package in <package dir>, which a run will find at <app root>;
#        touches nothing — `make ext-test` runs it on its unpacked copy before that replaces apps-ext/<id>)
#
# Refused (exit 2) before the bench is touched: an id that is not an extension id or is a
# core app (both as ffl_core.extensions.lint defines them, read through the bench's Python);
# a package without <id>/hooks.py; a package with wheels/ — bundled dependencies are installed
# by a store's ext-replay.sh, not here (yet); an apps/<id> this script did not make — a
# real directory, or a link to another folder that sites/apps.txt lists.
#
# Wires the extension into the bench the way deploy/prod/ext-replay.sh does — an
# apps/<id> symlink and a .pth, no package metadata — and
# installs it on <site>. Installed already (a re-run of `make ext-test`), it migrates
# the site instead: install-app would return at once, and the tests would run against
# the DocTypes, fields, fixtures and patches of the previous run. Then:
#   [1/3] bench --site <site> run-tests --app <id>     (a run that ran no test fails)
#   [2/3] python -m ffl_core.extensions.lint <root>
#   [3/3] scripts/generate_api_docs.py --app <root> --check   (endpoints documented; docs/api committed and fresh)
# All three run even after a failure. Exit 1 when the wiring, the tests, the lint or the API docs failed
# (parity, an endpoint without its docstring, Args or Returns, or Permissions prose contradicting a gate
# made of the extension's own roles: the generator's exit 1); 3 when the docs' only problem is one a core
# change alone makes — a stale docs/api, or Permissions prose naming other roles than a gate resolved
# through the core (the generator's exit 3: summary "docs STALE", the core CI only warns); 0 when all passed.
