"""woo_audit_dangling_ids — find (and optionally clear) Woo product ids whose
WooCommerce product was deleted on the store.

A "dangling" id is a stored ``woo_product_id`` on an Item or Serial No
whose WooCommerce product now 404s. It causes recurring push_stock / push_item
404s (which ``sync.py`` downgrades to warnings) with no self-healing — the CZ-75
incident. This is the durable garbage collector for them:

  * report-only by default; ``fix=1`` is the explicit write gate;
  * clears an id by nulling it + a Comment on the record + a warning log;
  * NEVER re-creates a product — a deletion on Woo may be deliberate, and silently
    re-listing it would be reverse-pollution;
  * a non-404 API error is a real failure and propagates, never mis-recorded.

Callable over HTTP and via
``bench execute ffl_woo_sync.woocommerce.dangling.woo_audit_dangling_ids``.
