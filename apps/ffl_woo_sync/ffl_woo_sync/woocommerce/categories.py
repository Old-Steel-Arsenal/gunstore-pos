"""The stores' product categories follow the catalog master's tree.

Each tree node (``Catalog Category``, read through ``ffl_core.catalog_tree``)
is linked to one product category per store, by id: the stored id; else the
node's ``store_hint`` slug (the store's existing term, first contact only); else a
term of the node's name under the parent's term; else, applying, a new term. The
linked term then takes the node's name, parent and order — its slug is never
touched (URLs stay) and no term is ever deleted. What cannot be linked without
guessing (two terms of that name, a term another node holds, a same-named term
under another parent) is reported instead.

A product's category is its Item's node (``catalog_category`` for a catalog Item, else
its Item Group's node) → that node's term on the store; a node not on the store
yet files under its nearest parent that is. Product pushes never create terms —
the mirror does, and (applying) then moves the products already on the store
under a node it just *created* a term for out of the parent's category
(``recategorize_site``, a job). A term *linked* to a node (by store slug or name)
moves nothing by itself: on a store's first Apply every node links at once, and
its products are rolled out by hand (lead 2026-09-27) — ``recategorize_store``
(System Manager) dry run, review the counts, then ``dry_run=0``; ``under``
limits it to subtrees.

The catalog side (the tree feed, product changes, ``m3_resync``) lives in
``ffl_integrations.catalog_master`` and reaches this module only through the two
hooks registered in this app's hooks.py (``catalog_category_store_mirror``,
``catalog_category_recategorize``): the channel apps never import each other.

	Apply (linking a term moves nothing by itself). Categories outside the tree

	Limit: a product's full push (and the catalog feed's re-categorise) still

	    under: node slugs (a list, JSON list or comma-separated) — only the
