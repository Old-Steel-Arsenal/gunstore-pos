"""Woo → POS product pull (operator-triggered content overwrite).

The reverse of the push pipeline, for exactly ONE product at a time, and only
on an operator's explicit click — the storefront plugin's product-page "overwrite POS
from WooCommerce" button.
Nothing in this module is scheduled or hooked; there is no bulk entrypoint on
purpose.  The whitelisted wrapper lives in ``client_api.pull_product_from_woo``.

What it writes (title + description + price + images):

=============  ======================  =====================================
Woo field      Item branch             Serial No branch (per-serial gun)
=============  ======================  =====================================
name           ``item_name``           ``item_name`` (per-gun listing title)
description    ``description`` (HTML   ``description`` — converted to PLAIN
               stored as-is)           TEXT (the field is a plain Text field;
                                       storing HTML would be double-escaped
                                       by the next full push)
regular_price  ``standard_rate`` AND   ``sell_price`` (only when the parent
               the selling Item Price  is NOT uniform-priced — under uniform
               via the canonical       pricing the serial tag is ignored by
               ``_set_item_selling_    ``firearm.serial_sell_price``, so the
               price`` helper (a bare  write would be a silent no-op; the
               ``standard_rate`` write pull records a ``price_note`` instead)
               does not change what
               the register charges)
sale_price /   ``sale_price`` +        ``sale_sell_price`` + ``sale_from`` /
date_on_sale_* ``sale_from`` /         ``sale_to`` (same uniform-parent guard
               ``sale_to`` — written   as the regular price). Unlike the
               UNCONDITIONALLY: a      regular price, 0/empty is meaningful —
               cleared wp-admin sale   it means "no sale", so the pull adopts
               must clear POS too      it instead of skipping
images         ``image_gallery`` rebuilt from downloaded copies; first image
               becomes ``is_primary`` and the single ``image`` field
=============  ======================  =====================================

Stock and attributes are deliberately NOT pulled: stock's SSOT is the POS,
and attributes/categories are derived from POS master data.

Canonical pieces reused rather than re-rolled: the SKU split
is ``webhook._map_sku_to_pos`` (the same rule web orders resolve by), the
echo guard is ``webhook.woo_site`` (BOTH inbound flags, save/restore), HTML
flattening is ``frappe.core.utils.html_to_plain_text`` (script/style
stripped, blocks → newlines, inline stays inline), and the Item price lands
through ``receive_goods._set_item_selling_price``.

Note on Serial No fields: ``item_name`` (fetch_if_empty) and ``description``
survive the save only because ffl_core's property setters cleared their
ERPNext ``fetch_from``/read-only defaults — ``test_pull_from_woo`` pins that
fixture contract so a fixture regression cannot silently revert this feature.
