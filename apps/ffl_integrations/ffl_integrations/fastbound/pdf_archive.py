"""Private copies of signed 4473 PDFs, attached to their Form 4473 Log row.

FastBound keeps every signed 4473, but a POS that can only show one live from
FastBound loses its whole history the day FastBound is switched off or the
account changes. So each FastBound 4473 on the log gets its PDF copied in once:
right after the form4473.completed webhook commits (webhook._record_4473_log)
and, for anything that missed that — the rows the backfill created, a
FastBound outage — by the hourly sweep.

The bytes are the buyer's 4473 (name, date of birth, address): they only ever
go into a private File, never into a log line or an Error Log.
