"""Build a dealer Customer/Supplier straight from an ATF FFL Record.

The natural B2B onboarding path: find the dealer in the directory (or pull
them in live via "+ Lookup by FFL #"), then one click creates the party with
is_ffl_dealer set and the formal atf_ffl_record link — the validate sync
(ffl_core.atf_link) fills the license fields from the record. Idempotent:
a party already carrying this FFL number is returned instead of duplicated.
