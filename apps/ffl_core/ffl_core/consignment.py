"""Runtime helpers for consignment intake.

ensure_consignor_supplier resolves — or creates — the Supplier a consigned
firearm's payable will eventually book against. Consignors are private
parties (the Customer who dropped off the gun), but ERPNext payables run
through Supplier, so intake mints a matching Supplier the first time a given
consignor's name is seen, then reuses it on every later consignment from the
same person (matched by supplier_name — mirrors _ensure_individual_supplier
in api/receive_goods.py, which does the same for the PR's own placeholder
Supplier).

See setup/consignment.py for the schema (Serial No fields, default
commission %, Consignment Payable account) this helper's caller
(compliance/purchase.py) stamps at receive time.

	A line value of 0 is treated as UNSET — identical to None/"" — NOT as an
	explicit "0% commission this sale" override. The policy is
	that a 0%-commission consignment sale does not exist (the store always keeps
	a cut), so an explicit 0% is no longer expressible: it falls back to the
	serial's rate. This also removes a latent ambiguity — the POS front end
	sends an untouched field as 0.0, and ERPNext's own round_floats_in coerces a
	truly-blank Percent field to 0.0 before any doc_event can read it, so an
	on-the-wire 0 could never be told apart from "operator left it blank";
	collapsing both to the serial rate is what an accountant audit called
	for. The freeze hook (compliance/consignment.freeze_consignment_commission)
	throws when even the serial rate resolves to <= 0, so a genuine 0 never
	reaches GL/reporting.

	Pure function: no DB access, so it's cheap to call from both the validate
	hook that freezes the value onto the line (compliance/consignment.py) and
	any later reporting/GL logic (A4/B1) that recomputes it for display.
