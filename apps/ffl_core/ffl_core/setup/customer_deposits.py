"""Idempotent setup for the "Customer Deposits" LIABILITY account, one per company.

Money taken against goods not yet handed over is owed to the customer, not
earned income. The account is looked up by name elsewhere (the GunBroker
cash-basis report), so every company keeps one.

Same lifecycle rules as the other setup modules (see the CI fresh-install
landmines memory): after_migrate, NEVER after_install (the account insert needs
a chart a fresh site doesn't have yet), and the migrate path never raises.
