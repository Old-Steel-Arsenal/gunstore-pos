"""Sideload: a zip uploaded on the Extensions page becomes an installed
extension without anyone touching the server.

Two halves, because ``install_app`` must never run before every container
can import the code (the moment a site lists an app as installed, a web
worker that cannot import it answers 500 to everything):

1. ``stage`` (long queue, this worker): lint again, move the code onto the
   apps-ext volume, add it to sites/extensions.json, run ext-replay.sh here
   to prove it wires and builds, then leave a request file for the agent.
   Any failure puts the volume and the manifest back exactly as they were.
2. The host agent (deploy/prod/ext-agent.sh, a systemd timer) sees the
   request, restarts every app container (each replays the manifest on
   start), then runs ``finish_install`` in the backend: the same
   install-on-this-site job the page already offers.

An upload whose id is already on the bench is an *upgrade*
when it came from upload or git and its version is newer: ``stage_upgrade``
backs the site up, keeps the old tree in apps-ext/.previous/<id> and swaps the
new one in; the agent restarts, then ``begin_upgrade`` → ``bench migrate`` →
``finish_upgrade``. A public https git repository becomes an upload
through ``inspect_git`` and follows the same path.

The entry's ``upgrade`` record says how far an upgrade got (
docs/self-hosting.md#extensions decides a rollback on these fields alone): ``state`` staged → done |
failed, and ``migrate`` not_started → started → succeeded — "started" is written
before any migrate runs the new code (begin_upgrade for the agent's, the core's
before_migrate hook for any other, e.g. a deploy's), "succeeded" once one has
(the core's after_migrate, finish_upgrade). Nothing is uploaded over an upgrade that did
not finish: it is rolled back, or its unrecorded success finished, by hand first
(unfinished_upgrade).

The rollback point = the entry's ``previous`` + ``backup`` +
apps-ext/.previous/<id>; the backup is sites/.ext-backups/<site>/<id>/, out of
reach of frappe's backup pruning. It moves on when the next upgrade is staged
(the older one is deleted then) and goes when the extension is uninstalled. One
thing runs on the pipeline at a time (``pipeline_busy``): the restart request is
a single file and the agent restarts every container.

Uploads live under the site's private files until staged; the manifest and
the request/done files live in sites/ (the shared volume), the code in
apps-ext/ (the other shared volume) — nothing container-local survives here.
