"""Stock-side companion to FFL Disposition.

FFL Disposition is the bound-book 'D' record — submitting one says "this firearm
left our FFL". The bound book (FastBound) sync is wired separately via
ffl_integrations.fastbound.tasks. This module covers the ERPNext-stock side:
when a non-Retail-Sale disposition submits, we Material-Issue the firearm out
of inventory so ERPNext, the Serial No state, the Item form, and the POS
picker all immediately reflect that the gun is gone.

Why this didn't auto-happen before:
  - FFL Disposition.on_submit only enqueued the FastBound push; nothing
    touched ERPNext stock.
  - Operators had to run "Sync Bound Book" (inventory_sync.py) to reconcile —
    a periodic recovery sweep, not a per-disposition write.
  - Result: a firearm could be in FastBound's bound book as disposed AND still
    Active in ERPNext, visible to POS and to other disposition pickers.

Retail Sale path is intentionally skipped — its stock is decremented by the
POS Invoice / Sales Invoice submit (ERPNext's standard sale flow), and the
disposition is created by the FastBound 4473 webhook AFTER stock already
moved. Issuing again would double-decrement.
