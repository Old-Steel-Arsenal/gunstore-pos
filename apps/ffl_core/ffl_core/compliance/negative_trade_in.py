"""A register ticket whose trade-ins exceed the goods: its sales tax, its tender, and the money paid out.

ERPNext lets such a ticket go below zero only when trade-in credit takes it there (compliance/negative_ticket);
the store then pays the customer the difference on the same ticket. Three things
follow, all POS Invoice hooks:

1. **Sales tax never goes negative.** ERPNext taxes a ticket line by line ("On Net Total"), so a credit larger than
   the taxable goods computes a NEGATIVE tax — a refund of tax nobody paid. Texas taxes the difference (Tax Code
   §151.007(c)(3)): 565 - 300 still taxes 265 (21.86); 565 - 5,450 taxes nothing, and the 4,885 is a purchase. So
   when a ticket carries trade-in credit and a tax row would come out below zero, that row's rate is set to 0 and
   ERPNext totals it again: the row, its per-item breakdown and the books all read 0.00, on the whole ticket, never
   carried to another. ``settle_tax_rates`` decides; it runs twice per save:

   * before_validate, after the locked-line pin: so ERPNext's own refusal of a negative total
     (is_negative_grand_total_allowed) already sees the floored total. Without it a $20 box of ammo against a $500
     trade-in would read -519.60, more than the credit, and be refused;
   * in the validate hooks, after ERPNext has totalled and before the trade-in gate reads the total: the amounts are
     final there (a pricing rule may have moved a rate after before_validate); whatever it changes is re-totalled
     and the tender checked again.

   The row keeps the rate it was floored from (``ffl_trade_in_floored_rate``) and gets exactly that back once the
   ticket no longer needs the floor, so a cart edited back to a positive ticket is taxed normally. A row nobody here
   floored is never given a rate: a 0% row set on purpose stays 0%. No template is read, so a ticket whose rows
   were typed in (no Sales Taxes and Charges Template) is floored the same way. A ticket without credit is never
   floored: a tax row below zero there is ERPNext's own business (a return).

2. **A negative ticket takes no tender** (``guard_negative_ticket``): every payment row is 0, there is no change, and
   the ticket says how the store paid (``ffl_trade_in_payout_method``; a reference unless cash). Payout to a
   customer only for guns bought from a private person — the same rule a seller payment follows.

3. **The payout is booked at submit** (``book_trade_in_payout``): cash_drawer.record_trade_in_payout, in the submit
   transaction, after the trade-ins themselves were booked (before_submit).
