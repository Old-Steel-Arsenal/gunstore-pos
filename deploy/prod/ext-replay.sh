#!/bin/bash
# Extension layer replay — runs on every container start (called by entrypoint.sh).
#
# Extension apps live OUTSIDE the image, on the apps-ext volume
# (deploy/prod/compose.extensions.yaml), and are declared in sites/extensions.json:
#
#   {"schema": 1, "extensions": {"<id>": {"version": "0.1.0", "source": "upload",
#                                          "sha256": "…", "installed_at": "…", "installed_by": "…"}}}
#
# This script makes the running container match that manifest, idempotently:
#   apps/<id>                        -> symlink to apps-ext/<id> (bench, esbuild and frappe find apps here)
#   env/…/site-packages/<id>.pth     one line, the app dir — the same .pth the baked apps' editable
#                                    installs left behind, so `import <id>` works with no pip and no
#                                    network. (No dist-info: an extension must not rely on
#                                    importlib.metadata / pip list for itself.)
#   env/…/site-packages/zz-ext-deps-<id>.pth  one line, apps-ext/.deps/<id>: the extension's pure-Python
#                                    dependencies. It ships them as wheels/*.whl next to pyproject.toml
#                                    (the lint checks tags, contents and requirements); the regular files
#                                    among them are installed there with `pip --no-index --no-deps
#                                    --target`, once per wheels/ content (stamp inside the tree), and the
#                                    new tree replaces the old one by two renames — a replay stopped in
#                                    between leaves .tmp / .old, which the next one clears and reinstalls.
#                                    site.py reads .pth files in name order and "zz-ext-deps-" sorts after
#                                    the baked apps' erpnext.pth / ffl_core.pth / frappe.pth …, so the deps
#                                    come after every core app on sys.path. The line is skipped while the
#                                    directory does not exist: no wheels, no cost. Never the network.
#   sites/apps.txt                   baked apps + declared extensions. frappe_docker's configurator
#                                    rewrites the file from `ls apps` on every `up`, and frappe's
#                                    install_app / bench build require the id in it — so declared ids
#                                    are appended and leftovers of removed extensions (a line whose
#                                    apps/<x> is our own symlink into apps-ext, does not exist at all,
#                                    or is a dangling link) are dropped. Anything else is left alone.
#   apps-ext/<id>/<id>/public/dist   esbuild output, lives with the app on the volume. Compiled when the
#                                    stamp (manifest version | source hash | frappe | ffl_core versions,
#                                    kept in apps-ext/.built/<id>) changes or dist lacks the bundles the
#                                    sources declare; otherwise `bench build --using-cached` only
#                                    re-registers the files in this container's assets.json (≈3 s) and
#                                    clears the redis assets_json key.
#
# Ordering: the container-local wiring (symlink, .pth) is done before the shared
# lock, so `bench` commands exec'd into a freshly started container can import
# the extension while another container still compiles assets. /tmp/ext-replay.done
# marks the end of the whole replay for scripts that need the assets too — it is
# $BENCH/.ext-replay.done, container-local, re-armed on every start.
#
# Contract: any error exits non-zero WITH a message, and the container does NOT start. A site
# with the extension installed cannot run without its code anyway (hooks import fails on every
# request); failing loudly beats a half-dead POS. Recovery: restore the files, or uninstall the
# extension from every site first and then remove it from the manifest (docs/self-hosting.md#extensions) — deleting
# the manifest entry alone turns a restart loop into a 500 loop. Without a manifest this is a
# one-line no-op.
